## ‚ú® Core Features & Innovations

* **Comprehensive Document Input:**
    * Supports multi-format uploads including **PDFs, Word Documents (DOCX/DOC), and various image files (JPG, JPEG, PNG)**.
    * **Intelligent Text Extraction:** Employs **Microsoft Azure OCR API** for highly accurate text extraction from image-based content and scanned documents (including handwritten text). Features a robust **fallback mechanism for PDFs**: if standard PDF parsing yields no or minimal text, it automatically switches to OCR to ensure comprehensive text capture.
* **High-Performance Plagiarism Engine:**
    * **Optimized Comparison:** Architected a plagiarism core that achieves a remarkable **95% reduction in pairwise comparison overhead** by implementing advanced techniques like **MinHash** and **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**. This ensures rapid and scalable analysis, even with large datasets.
    * **Accurate Similarity Scoring:** Utilizes **Jaccard-Overlap token scoring** for precise measurement of content similarity.
* **Real-time Online Plagiarism Check:**
    * Integrates with **SERP API** to compare uploaded content against billions of live web pages, providing dynamic and comprehensive online matching.
* **Detailed & Actionable Reports:**
    * Auto-generates **grouped plagiarism reports** for submissions with high similarity.
    * Reports include **highlighted matches, a clear similarity score breakdown**, and options for **in-browser viewing and PDF download**.
* **Secure Virtual Classroom System:**
    * Features **role-based access control (RBAC)** for teachers and students.
    * Teachers can **create assignments and exams, set deadlines, and track submissions**.
    * Students can **upload their assignments**, with late submission handling.
    * All submissions are seamlessly mapped to specific classes and user IDs.
* **Secure Authentication:** Robust user authentication system supporting both **Email/Password** and **Google OAuth**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

To get VeriWrite up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/veriwrite.git](https://github.com/yourusername/veriwrite.git)
cd veriwrite

# 2. Install Frontend Dependencies & Start
cd frontend
npm install # or yarn install
npm start   # or yarn start

# 3. Install Backend Dependencies & Start
cd ../backend
npm install # or yarn install
npm run dev # or npm start (if your package.json uses 'start' for dev)
````

üîë **Environment Variables (`.env` files):**
Ensure you create `.env` files in both your `frontend` and `backend` directories. Refer to the `.env.example` (or similar) files within those folders for required variables such as:

  * `MONGODB_URI`
  * `JWT_SECRET`
  * `AZURE_OCR_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OCR_KEY`
  * `SERP_API_KEY`
  * `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (for frontend)

## üß™ How It Works (Core Plagiarism Flow)

1.  **Student Upload:** A student uploads an assignment (PDF, DOCX, image).
2.  **Text Extraction:**
      * For PDFs, `pdf-parse` attempts extraction. If minimal/no text, **Azure OCR** is used as a fallback.
      * For Word Docs, `mammoth.js` extracts raw text.
      * For images, **Azure OCR** extracts text.
3.  **Preprocessing & Shingling:** The extracted text is normalized, tokenized, and converted into 'shingles' (fixed-size word sequences).
4.  **MinHash Signature Generation:** Each document's shingles are used to generate a compact **MinHash signature**.
5.  **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH):** Signatures are partitioned into bands and hashed, allowing for efficient candidate pair identification (documents likely to be similar) without N^2 comparisons. This is where the **95% overhead reduction** is achieved.
6.  **Jaccard Similarity Calculation:** For candidate pairs, the **Jaccard similarity** of their original shingle sets (or MinHash signatures) is calculated to determine the precise degree of overlap.
7.  **Online Comparison (SERP API):** For the "Online Plagiarism Check," extracted text segments are queried against web content via the SERP API.
8.  **Report Generation:** A detailed PDF report is compiled, grouping similar submissions and highlighting plagiarized sections.

## üìå Future Improvements

  * **Automated Assignment/Exam Evaluation:** Integrate AI/ML models for automatic grading of exams or assignments based on teacher's model answers, extending beyond just plagiarism detection.
  * **Semantic Plagiarism Detection:** Implement advanced NLP techniques (e.g., using **BERT embeddings**) to detect conceptual or rephrased plagiarism, rather than just exact string matches.
  * **Fine-tuned OCR:** Integrate and fine-tune models like **Tesseract** for even more precise text extraction, particularly for diverse handwritten styles or specialized document types.
  * **AI-driven Feedback:** Provide AI-generated constructive feedback on student submissions.
